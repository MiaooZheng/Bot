checkout bot

For this project, I'm going to make a checkout bot to purchase the shoes. As the size i want is unavailable right now, i'll try to connect with email notifications or use airflow to check whether item is available per 30mins. 

Current plan: 
- finish the rest of code, choose size, add to cart and checkout. 
- connect to email and when I receive notification, run the above code immediately. 
- use airflow to automatically check availability per 30mins and buy if available.
